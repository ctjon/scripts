Use the dhcp_dns.sh script as a scheduled job running once per minute.  It scans
the DHCP leases file and looks for entries that have expired and/or new entries
that are created.  When these events occur, the script parses them out an uses
nsupdate to update the dns records.

This is only necessary because synology's DHCP server does not automatically 
update DNS as it should IMHO.  This solution solves the problem without actual
modification of any system config files and thus won't inadvertenly break 
anything during a DSM upgrade.
